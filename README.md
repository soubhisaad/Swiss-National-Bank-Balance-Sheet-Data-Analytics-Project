# Swiss-National-Bank-Data-Analysis-and-Forecasting-SQL-Machine-Learning-Approach

> **By Soubhi SAAD**

This project analyzes the Swiss National Bankâ€™s (SNB) balance sheet using Python (for machine learning and API data collection), SQL, pgAdmin, and Microsoft Power BI. It explores the impact of major crises like the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19, as well as foreign exchange interventions and shifts in liquidity, reserves, and public cash demand over time.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights


### Liquidity Surge Post-2011
Sight deposits jumped from ~10% to over **50% of total liabilities** after the SNB introduced the EUR/CHF exchange rate floor in 2011, revealing a long-lasting shift to a liquidity-heavy policy stance.

### Crisis-Driven Balance Sheet Growth
The SNBâ€™s **total assets soared** during both the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Between March 2020 and December 2021, assets rose by CHF **204 billion** due to aggressive foreign asset purchases.

### Cash Demand Peaked in 2021
**Banknotes in circulation** reached an all-time high of **CHF 88.5B**, showing how households shifted to physical cash during the COVID crisis. Seasonal spikes also reveal holiday- and confidence-driven behavior.

### Foreign Currency Investments as a Monetary Tool
SNB **foreign currency investments** peaked at **CHF 1,015B**, while liabilities remained low â€” proving that the bank printed CHF to buy foreign assets. After 2022, investments declined as the SNB shifted to fighting inflation.

### Goldâ€™s Role Continues to Shrink
Gold dropped from **~30% to under 15%** of total assets over time, showing a strategic move away from traditional reserves toward more liquid, policy-driven instruments.

### Record Balance Sheet Peaks (2021â€“2022)
The five highest asset levels in SNB history were recorded between **Dec 2021 and May 2022**, marking the peak of its post-crisis monetary expansion.

### Balance Sheet Composition Transformation
Over the past 25+ years, the SNBâ€™s balance sheet evolved from being **gold- and cash-heavy** to being dominated by **foreign currency investments and sight deposits**, showing a move from traditional reserve banking to modern interventionism.
